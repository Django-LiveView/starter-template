# Django template for creating a complete HTML over the Wire site

This template has an example of the most common cases.

- Navigation Real-time without loads similar to SPA.
- Server-Side Rendering (SSR) of pages for SEO (Using `views.py`).
- Multilanguage.
- Switch to a static page (Home).
- Switch to a dynamic page (List of cats üêàüêàüêàüêàüêàüêà).
- Single page (Cat üêà).
- Add a new item in the database (üë∂üèªüêà).
- Delete item from the database (üêà‚ò†).
- Update item from the database (üêàüëâüêï).
- Broadcast: Sending information to all customers in Real-time (Feline notifications üêàüì¢).
- Navigator whose active button changes dynamically.
- Contact form with validations.
- Collect file from a client (üêàüñºÔ∏è).
- Login.
- Private Page (üêà‚Äç‚¨õ).
- Get information from an API and render it (comments from [jsonplaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)).
- URL dynamic update in Browser (Front-End).
- Security: Cross-site request forgery protection over WebSockets.
- RSS feed.
- Sitemap.

## URLs

- `/` -> Home.
- `/cats/` -> List of cats. 
- `/cats/felix/` -> Single cat.
- `/cats/felix/new/` -> Add new cat.
- `/cats/felix/update/` -> Update cat.
- `/contact/` -> Contact.
- `/login/` -> Login.
- `/profile/` -> Private page.
- `/comments/` -> List API commets.
- `/rss.xml` -> Feed cat.
- `/sitemap.txt` -> Sitemap.

## How does the information move?

When an event occurs in the frontend, **HTML generation is not JavaScript's job**. All logic, rendering, updating and any functionality is handled by the backend.

A simple case: a button that when clicked displays a modal. The flow of actions would be as follows:

1. Stimulus would capture the `click` event.
2. The Stimulus Controller function sends via WebSockets (using `sendData`), the action it needs together with the collected information. 
3. `consumers.py` would decide which functionality should be executed. They are hosted in the appropriate action.
4. Action (`actions` directory) is executed by rendering the new HTML from a template. Perhaps `modal.html`.
5. The HTML is sent via `consumer.send_html()` through WebSockets to the client that has requested to execute the action.
6. Frontend receives a JSON with the new HTML, along with other properties. Inside JSON is specified in which `id` the prerendered HTML should be inserted. In this case it will fill an empty element with `modal.html` contain.

Additionally, without the frontend having to intervene, the browser URL is updated or it is decided whether the HTML is to be replaced or added.

## Concepts

### Actions

Place where the functions and logic of the business logic are stored.

### Views

Where to generate URLs for Server-Side Rendering (SSR). It uses the same logic, and therefore resulting HTML, as dynamic views.

### Consumers

Controller between the frontend and the backend. It captures the frontend queries and their information, to execute the appropriate action. 

### Templates

HTML templates that will use the `views.py` for SSR and the actions for rendering the different elements or responses.
